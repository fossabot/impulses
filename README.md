<h2 align="center">Supporting Impulses.js</h2>

Impulses.js is an MIT-licensed open source project. It's an independent project with its ongoing development made possible entirely thanks to the support by these awesome [backers](https://github.com/impulsesjs/lib/blob/dev/BACKERS.md). If you'd like to join them, please consider:

- [Become a backer or sponsor on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/joaocorreia).
- [Become a backer or sponsor on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/impulses). We still don't have this option since we do not have enough stars yet. (maybe you can help here)
- One-time donation via PayPal or crypto-currencies (It will be linked soon) or, simply [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/correia)... 

#### What's the difference between Patreon and OpenCollective?

Funds donated via Patreon go directly to support Joao Correia full-time work on impulses.js and many other ideas. Funds donated via OpenCollective are managed with transparent expenses and will be used for compensating work and expenses for core team members or sponsoring community events. Your name/logo will receive proper recognition and exposure by donating on either platform.
